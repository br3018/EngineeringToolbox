# EngineeringToolbox

In the 2021 summer we decided to start an "engineering toolbox", a github repo bringing together particularly useful scripts and tools.

For deploying these scripts, I believe [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) provides a great option. It allows you to turn your tool into something highly accessible and interactive with very little effort. For now at least, they also provide free cloud hosting allowing for effortless deployment allowing access for anyone from anywhere.

I would love to encourage using this one github repo to share any scripts that have provable use to the team. It would be brilliant to use this for any small scripts being used to make design decisions. However, we should take care that any scripts uploaded here are both useful and relatively neatly coded.
